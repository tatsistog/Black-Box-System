# Black-Box-System
The purpose of this project is to identify a black-box system and find a model (actually an ordinary differential equation) that perfectly fits the data. 


Remarkable files:
out.p: This file is actually the black box system
linearity_checking.m: Experimental proof that we deal with a linear system
offline_modeling.m: Finds a model that fits input-output data, using the offline version of least squares algorithm. 
online_modeling.m: Finds a model that fits input-output data, using the online version of least squares algorithm.
